Audio-driven [stories](https://help.flourish.studio/article/13-creating-a-story), or [talkies](https://flourish.studio/2019/02/07/audio-talkie-visualisation-data-stories/), are a way to combine clear narrative and interactivity in order to break down the distinction between data explanation and data exploration.

To create your own talkie,

## 100 - Create a Flourish Story with as many slide as you like

## 200 - Under Audio/autoplay choose Enabled

Slide the slider to ```Enabled``` for **Autoplay story**, in the story editor. 

## 300 - Upload your voiceover as an MP3 file



## 400 - Set durations for each slide to line up visuals with the audio


## 500 - Hit Publish to share or embed

It's also possible to skip the audio upload step to make an “autoplay” story that silently progresses through the slides at specified times, optionally looping at the end. This can be handy, for example, when using a Flourish data story on a big screen at an event.
